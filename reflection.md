# **P5 Sketch 2 Reflection**
For this sketch, I drew the Avenues logo with its edge/radius defined by the mouse position. The main challenging aspect of this drawing was intially determining how to do the math and geometry regarding the mouse coordinates defining the edge position because the myShape function is rectangular and corner centered rather than center centered like the circle shape which I needed for the logo. Figuring this out gave me a better sense of the geometry involved with the different shape functions like myShape, circle, arc, etc.
